# 8 Ball Pool Aim Guide
Used to improve aim on the Miniclip 8 Ball Pool game. This is very crude and not refined at all as I made in around an hour after not writing JavaScript for a year. It was a small project that I saw someone else do and wanted to try and replicate it.

### **How to use**
 * Load the unpacked extension in Google Chrome.
 * Visit https://www.miniclip.com/games/8-ball-pool-multiplayer/ to use the tool.
 * <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Alt/Option</kbd> Lets you set the locations of the holes
 * <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Backspace</kbd> Sets the centre on the ball
 * Win lots of games!

Note: This was made very quickly, things may break/not work at any point. There's nothing to worry about, though.
